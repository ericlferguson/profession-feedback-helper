# Engineering Feedback Tool

This tool is designed to assist professional Engineering Managers in providing effective and structured feedback to their direct reports. The feedback framework is heavily based on the [Dropbox Engineering Career Framework](https://dropbox.github.io/dbx-career-framework/), ensuring that expectations and responsibilities are clear and consistent.

## Features

- **Structured Feedback**: Provides a systematic way to deliver feedback aligned with established career frameworks.
- **Role-Based Expectations**: Feedback is tailored based on specific roles within the engineering team.

## Current Scope

Please note that the current implementation is limited to the **Machine Learning Engineer (MLE)** role. Support for additional roles will be added in future updates.

## Usage

*Usage instructions to be added soon.*
